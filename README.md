# Serac

A lightweight REST client for macOS.

## About

The goal of this project is to build a simple, native client suitable for
consuming JSON-based REST APIs. It has a very focused objective: support the minimal
feature set required for working with HTTP API endpoints that communicate using JSON
requests and responses.

You'll need at least macOS 11.x and Xcode 12.x or newer.

There are currently no other third-party dependencies required. You can open the project
in Xcode and build it right away!
